Soft lights flicker through the windowpane
I watch the rain fall, calling out your name
Neon dreams wrapped in satin skies
Can't help but wonder if you feel this night inside
Heartbeats echo in the distance
Every second feels like something's missing
If just one moment could freeze, I'd hold you close to me
I really want to stay at your house tonight
Drift in your arms under neon city lights
Take me where time dissolves, where we collide
I really want to stay at your house tonight
Empty streets shimmer, reflections on the road
Lost in your whispers, letting secrets go
Soft confessions in the amber glow
I'm drawn like moth to flame, wherever you go
Heartbeat racing through the silence
Every breath a fragile kind of promise
If only for a moment, let me taste your mystery
I really want to stay at your house tonight
Drift in your arms under neon city lights
Take me where time dissolves, where we collide
I really want to stay at your house tonight
Moonlight dances on your skin,
Traces of you laced within
Flickers of the world outside
Fade away when you are by my side
I really want to stay, don't let this feeling fade
Hold me close, and chase the shadows from our days
Take me where time dissolves, hearts collide
I really want to stay at your house tonight
City's hum grows faint, I'm drifting into you
In your arms I find a place that feels like truth
I really want to stay… yes, I really want to stay tonight.
