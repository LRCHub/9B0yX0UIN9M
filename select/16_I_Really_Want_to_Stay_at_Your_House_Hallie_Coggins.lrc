[00:01.11] I couldn't wait for you to come and clear the cupboard
[00:08.85] But now you're gone and leaving nothing but a sign
[00:16.58] Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines
[00:24.23] Because I miss you all the time
[00:39.73] 
[00:30.09] So, get away
[00:32.35] Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
[00:36.67] And let yourself go
[00:39.51] You know you didn't lose your self-control
[00:43.68] Let's start at the rainbow
[00:46.47] Turn away
[00:47.69] Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
[00:52.21] And let yourself go
[00:54.90] Is that a compromise?
[01:05.40] 
[01:00.02] So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
[01:04.29] There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
[01:08.16] A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
[01:11.92] I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
[01:15.43] 'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
[01:19.35] And I hope it all works out
[01:22.90] But you know how much you broke me apart
[01:25.81] I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
[01:29.24] I don't wanna know, ahh
[01:40.74] 
[01:40.90] And I'm awarе that you were lying in the gutter
[01:48.64] 'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
[01:56.22] So when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies
[02:03.97] And why do I still wanna call you (call you, call you, call you)
[02:35.97] 
[02:09.21] So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
[02:13.33] There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
[02:17.12] A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
[02:21.03] I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
[02:24.41] 'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
[02:28.44] And I hope it all works out
[02:32.08] But you know how much you broke me apart
[02:35.00] I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
[02:38.38] I don't wanna know
[02:47.38] 
[02:41.38] Ohh
[02:48.05] Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[02:50.74] I don't know why I'm no one
[03:04.24] 
[02:55.99] So, get away
[02:58.24] Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
[03:02.61] And let yourself go
[03:05.49] You know you didn't lose your self-control
[03:09.45] Let's start at the rainbow
[03:12.32] Turn away
[03:13.62] Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
[03:17.94] And let yourself go
[03:20.88] Is that a compromise?
[03:31.38] 
[03:29.74] So what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
[03:34.08] There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
[03:37.84] A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
[03:41.74] I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
